Some general guidelines for a PhD that I believe in and the way I supervise my students:
You will have to get out of your school mentality where a teacher gives you homework and you can complete only that to get "full marks". For PhD studies, 
you don't have a teacher, only an advisor (and I don't like the word "supervisor"). As the name suggests, the advisor neither assigns you homework nor 
provides you marks. You will have to learn to give yourself homework and grade your own work honestly.
As there are no regular milestones, it is easy to waste time, while "looking" busy. It is often easy to fool yourself that you are busy. 

So, try to assign 
yourself concrete tasks and set your own deadlines to complete them. Do a retrospection at the end of each day.
The problem may be suggested by your advisor but has to be owned by you. It is not your advisor's PhD problem, it is your PhD problem. It is to your 
interest that you keep your advisor involved in your problem with regular progress and regular meetings. As your advisor will 
be handling multiple problems, it is quite natural that s/he might start losing interest in the problems that are not showing progress. 
Don't let it be your problem that your advisor has forgotten about.
Try to maintain a research log of your work and of future problems that your advisor might suggest, or you may think of. Good research problems are 
hard to come by, so respect them and treat them with care.
Don't overwork. It is a marathon and not a sprint. Have some hobbies that allow you to switch off. Having said that, certain periods are more crucial 
than others, like when you have a paper deadlines or you are on a research visit. Working very hard at these times will yield you much bigger rewards 
than other times.

Do not be in a race for papers but do recognize their importance. Papers should be a side-effect of your work, not the other way. 
But do realize that it is the only indicator the rest of the world will judge you by. 
Realize that it is your paper, not your advisor's; you are typically the first author and the advisor is the last. 
You should take ownership and complete it. If you want your advisor's comments, submit the draft to him/her with enough time on hand. 
Don't submit work-in-progress drafts for review as you will only get superficial comments that you will yourself be aware of and the reviewer 
will get a bad impression about your writing. Also, it is difficult to review a section of a paper in isolation. 

A paper is a story: how about I tell you the middle part of a story without the beginning or the climax?
Try to complete your problem as soon as you can. Research is a race, and if some other paper comes along that uses a similar idea, 
all your work will be wasted, so never sit on a research problem.
Finally, enjoy your PhD. If you are not, you should immediately talk to you advisor.
I believe there are two distinct dimensions of a PhD student:

Work ethics: there are students who work hard (work ~ 80 hrs per week) with discipline (A) and other who like to work in an easy-paced 
(work ~ 60 hrs per week) manner (B).

Research vision: There are students who want to do an excellent PhD (X) and others who only want a PhD degree (Y).

So, there are four types of students:
AX: they should only target top conferences and look to finish in 5-6 years.
BX: target top conferences and look to finish in 6-8 years.
AY: look to publish in second tier conferences and expect to finish in 4-5 years.
BY: target second tier conferences and try to finish in 5-7 years.

You should honestly answer for yourself what category you belong to. Your advisor, by default, expects you to be an AX category student and 
assigns you work accordingly. You should immediately have a chat with your advisor if that is not the case; otherwise the false expectations
will make life difficult for both of you.

If you are spending less than 50 hrs every week, then you may find it very difficult to complete a reasonable PhD in a reasonable time. 
Also, understand that this is average workload, you may have to spend many more hours near a paper deadline and you will of course take 
holidays when you are not expected to work. Again, this is simply a back of the hand estimate, and different students can work efficiently 
only for different amounts of time. Understand yourself and create a schedule that works for you. And, this time is the time for all activities 
that help your PhD (working on your implementation, reading papers, reviewing papers, viewing lectures, working out problem with pen and paper, 
preparing talks, discussing your problems with your colleagues), not the time you are sitting in front of a computer.
